            <h3>A Little Note For You...</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, things don't go as planned, and it's okay to feel a little blue. But remember, one small moment doesn't define your sparkle or your worth. You are so much more than any single event.</p>
            <p>Your real "proms" in life â€“ those big, beautiful, unforgettable moments â€“ are still to come, and they will be uniquely YOURS. They'll be filled with people who cherish you and celebrate you, just for being the incredible person you are.</p>

            <p>Every day is a new chance to shine. Keep being your wonderful self, because that's the most beautiful thing of all.</p>
